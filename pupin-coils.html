                Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "<b><i>Pupin coils</i></b>", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <ins>Oliver Heaviside</ins>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (<i>AT&T</i>), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <ins>George Campbell</ins> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
